				<h1 align="center">SURFING</h1>
			</span>
			<span>
				<p>Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on
				the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves
				suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in
				lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.</p>

				<p>The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of
				boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia,
				paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day
				definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as
				stand-up surfing.</p>

				<p>
					Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their
					belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of
					surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is
					caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to
					be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one
					strap over it to fit on one hand.
				</p>

				<p>Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several
				major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.</p>

				<p>In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle such as
				a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is
				generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and
				sea kayaking that are self-propelled by hand paddles do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite
				surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves.
				Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged.As of 2013,
				the Guinness Book of World Records recognized a 23.8 m (78 ft) wave ride by Garrett McNamara at Nazaré, Portugal as the
				largest wave ever surfed.</p>

				<p>Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding and performing tricks using
					a
					skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment industry job, and a method of
					transportation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009
					report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue, with 11.08 million
					active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding would be represented at the 2020
					Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male and female teams.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle BMXers,
					aggressive
					skaters, and more recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the
					activity,
					although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and parks.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate
					scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed
					rudimentary
					handlebars.[7][8][9] The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.[1]
				</p>
				<p>
					Skateboarding, as it exists today, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s,[citation needed]
					when
					surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called "sidewalk surfing" – a new
					wave
					of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it
					seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards
					were
					ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill
					Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to
					square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted "sidewalk surfing" and early skaters
					emulated
					surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.[7][1][10]
				</p>
				<p>
					The magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as Skateboarder in 1975.[15][16][17] The first
					broadcast
					of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in
					Anaheim,
					California and aired on ABC's Wide World of Sports.[18][19] Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time,
					there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.[7]
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the
					country to
					do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of Life
					magazine[1][20]
					in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs—The Mike Douglas Show, What's My Line? and The
					Tonight
					Show Starring Johnny Carson—which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time.[21][22][23] Some other
					well
					known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards,
					Woody Woodward, and Jim Fitzpatrick.
